* Installation
1. using wget
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AfzGit/pegasus-skyscraper/main/pgsk
chmod a+x pgsk
sudo mv pgsk /usr/bin/
#+END_SRC

2. using curl
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AfzGit/pegasus-skyscraper/main/pgsk --output pgsk
chmod a+x pgsk
sudo mv pgsk /usr/bin/
#+END_SRC
* Usage
=pgsk [DIRECTORY] [PLATFORM] [COMMAND]=

[DIRECTORY] = Location of the games folder (like =~/Games/PS2=)

[PLATFORM] = name of the console/platform (always lowercase, like =ps2=)

"[COMMAND]" = Optional command to execute when game is selected in pegasus-frontend, needs to be in quotes (like "pcsx2-qt {file.path}")

Note 1: The media folder and the metadata file are both stored in [DIRECTORY]. Add the metadata file in pegasus-frontend for media and games to be detected.
Note 2: The "[COMMAND]" will be stored in ~/.config/pgsk/commands.txt and will execute automatically the next time for the same [PLATFORM].
Note 3: View supported platform by writing =pgsk -p=
* Examples
** Example 1:
Fetching media for a GBA game:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pgsk ~/Games/GBA/ gba
#+END_SRC

stores media and metadata in "~/Games/GBA/"
** Example 2:
Fetching media for a WII game and setting a command:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pgsk ~/Games/WII/ wii "dolphin-emu {file.path}"
#+END_SRC

stores media and metadata in "~/Games/WII/"
also sets the command to execute when selected in pegasus.
Once set, these commands are stored in "~/.config/pgsk/commands.txt" and will be called automatically next time without the [COMMAND] argument for wii.
** Example 3:
It is recommended to drop all your commands in the config file:

~/config/pgsk/commands.txt
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
gba:mgba-qt -f {file.path}
#+END_SRC

then use pgsk and it will detect the command automatically and set it.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pgsk ~/Games/GBA/ gba
#+END_SRC
